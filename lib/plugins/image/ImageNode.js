// TODO
// * check if we have props.data.url. We do? Set that as the source image URL, call it a day!
// * props.data.url does not exist? Ok, does props.data.file exist? Yeah?
// * Does props.uploadFile exist? If yes, then invoke it with the file object. If not, do nothing, error out.
// * show loading spinner until promise resolves
// * resolved value should give out URL. If rejected, show error layout with "try again" button
// * set data.url property.
// * component should reload and then we're back at step 1!

// TODO UI things needed
// * Nice loading thing that shows progress bar or something
// * An error overlay
// * An outline around the node
// * Scale down image to find the document width and height

// TODO Add caption, will need some css work
